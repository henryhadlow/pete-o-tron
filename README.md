===========
This is an attempt to reproduce my corporate worth with less than 5KB of code.

It is currently using arrays in the javascript.  Soon it will pull those arrays from googledocs.  Then shit will get real.

I want to a) make a greeting generator, and b) see what I can do about pulling data from google docs and other api calls start building dashboards etc.

This is a fun way to learn these things.
